# remarkable_news

reMarkable service to automatically download daily newspaper/comic as your suspend screen.  No cloud needed.

![demo](pic.png)

## Quickstart (Linux/OSX)

    git clone http://github.com/evidlo/remarkable_news && cd remarkable_news
    make download_prebuilt
    make install_nyt

This will install and start the update service on the reMarkable.  Every time you connect to WiFi, it will try to grab the latest front page from The New York Times.

Alternatively, you can build the binary yourself before installation if you omit `make download_prebuilt`.

    make install_nyt

By default, downloads are rate limited to once per hour (3600 s).  This can be overriden

    # set rate limit to once per 10 min
    make install_nyt cooldown=600

## Install (Windows)

Install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/2-enable-and-install), then follow the Linux/OSX instructions.  This has not been tested.
